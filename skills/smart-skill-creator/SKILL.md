description: Create new skills, modify and improve existing skills, and measure skill performance. Use whenever the user wants to create a skill from scratch, turn a workflow into a reusable skill, edit or optimize an existing skill, run evals or benchmark a skill with variance analysis, or sharpen a skill's description for better triggering accuracy, even if they don't say the word "skill" but describe wanting Claude to do a repeatable task the same way every time. Do NOT use when the user wants Claude to perform the task itself (write code, fix a bug, draft a doc) rather than package it, or when a lighter container fits: an always-true convention belongs in CLAUDE.md, a per-path rule in .claude/rules, and a guarantee that must hold every time in a hook, not a skill.

# Skill Creator

A skill for creating new skills and iteratively improving them.

The core loop:

1. Decide what the skill should do and roughly how.
2. Write a draft.
3. Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on a few realistic test prompts in the background; draft quantitative evals while they run.
4. Show the user the results with `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` — qualitative outputs and quantitative metrics.
5. Rewrite based on their feedback and any flaws the benchmarks expose; repeat, then expand the test set and rerun at larger scale.

Your job is to find where the user is in this loop and jump in — they might say "I want to make a skill for X" (start at step 1) or arrive with a draft (skip to eval/iterate). Stay flexible: if they say "skip the evals, just vibe with me," do that. After the skill is solid, run the description improver (separate script) to optimize triggering.

## Communicating with the user

Users span a wide range of coding-jargon familiarity. Read context cues and calibrate:

- "evaluation" and "benchmark" are borderline but usually OK.
- For "JSON" and "assertion," wait for clear signals the user knows the terms before using them unexplained.

When in doubt, briefly define a term rather than assume.

## Creating a skill

### Is this a skill?

Before writing a skill, confirm a skill is the right container. A skill body loads into context every time it triggers and stays there for the session, so reach for one only when nothing lighter does the job:

- **Always-true convention** (naming, style, a one-line gotcha) → a line in `CLAUDE.md`, not a skill.
- **Rule scoped to certain paths** → a path-scoped rule (`.claude/rules/*.md` with a `paths:` glob), so it loads only when Claude touches a matching file.
- **Guarantee that must hold every time** → a hook. Prose is a polite request re-issued every turn; a hook is enforced once and free forever, so it's the right tool for "never push to main"-style invariants.
- **Multi-step procedure, needs scripts, or only matters in one corner of the work** → a skill. That's the case the rest of this section covers.

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.

Check available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.

### Write the SKILL.md

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier
- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All "when to use" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to "undertrigger" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit "pushy". So for instance, instead of "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.", you might write "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'"
- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)
- **the rest of the skill :)**

### Skill Writing Guide

#### Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
```

Name skills in gerund form (`processing-pdfs`, `writing-documentation`); avoid vague names like `helper` or `utils`. For the full folder layout, the complete frontmatter field reference (including Claude Code's invocation-control fields), and naming rules, read `references/skill-anatomy.md`.

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

These word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.

The economics that follow: a SKILL.md body is a **recurring** cost — once the skill triggers it stays in context for the rest of the session, competing with the live task on every turn. A reference file is a **one-time, on-demand** cost (zero tokens until read) and a script is near-free (only its output). So push anything not needed on every run *down* a tier. `references/skill-anatomy.md` covers the loading model and these token budgets in depth.

**Key patterns:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: when a skill spans multiple domains/frameworks, split references by variant (e.g., `references/aws.md`, `references/gcp.md`) so Claude reads only the relevant one. Keep references one level deep, forward-slashed, and add a table of contents to any file over ~100 lines. `references/skill-anatomy.md` covers the loading model in depth, including the Claude Code skill-listing budget (run `/doctor` to detect overflow) and how skills are re-attached after compaction.

#### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though. Treat installed skills as a security surface too: install only from trusted sources, audit bundled scripts and references for unexpected network calls, and remember that frontmatter is injected into the system prompt, so it is itself an injection vector.

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if "Input" and "Output" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

**Calibrate degrees of freedom**: give text-level direction when many approaches are valid (e.g., code review), and exact, unparameterized script commands when an operation is fragile and consistency matters. Favor concrete input→output examples over abstract rules, and capture real failure points in a **Gotchas** section — often the highest-signal content in a skill. Avoid piling up ALL-CAPS `MUST`/`NEVER` rules with no reasoning; state the rule _and the why_ so the model generalizes to edge cases. See `references/writing-instructions.md` for voice, templates, validation loops, and the full anti-pattern list.

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

Aim for **one skill, one job** — skills that straddle several purposes confuse the agent. When a mechanical step repeats across runs, bundle it as a script rather than re-describing it each time; see `references/bundling-scripts.md` for agent-friendly script interfaces and dependency management. When authoring specifically for Claude Code (invocation control, slash-command behavior, argument substitution, proven skill categories), read `references/claude-code-specifics.md`.

### Grade and Tighten

Before writing test cases, grade the draft against the seven rules in `references/token-field-guide.md`. Read that file, then score each rule pass/fail and fix every failure before moving on.

| Rule | Check |
|------|-------|
| R1 — Description triggers | Includes WHAT + WHEN + concrete trigger phrases + at least one negative trigger? |
| R2 — Body earns tokens | Every line survives "if deleted, would Claude err?" — no obvious defaults, stale refs, contradictions, or option menus? |
| R3 — Knowledge addressed, not imported | Heavy docs live in `references/` with a pointer, not inlined in the body? |
| R4 — Mechanical work compiled | Deterministic steps → scripts; one concrete example replaces abstract prose rules? |
| R5 — Critical rules front-loaded | Most important content in first 20%; ≤2 `IMPORTANT`/`MUST` markers total? |
| R6 — Output constrained | Skill instructs Claude to produce structured output, cap volume, or write reasoning to file? |
| R7 — One job | Scope narrow enough that overlap with other skills is zero or explicitly excluded via negative triggers? |

Fix each failure, then re-check. Don't move to test cases until all seven pass or are explicitly justified.

### Test Cases

After writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] "Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?" Then run them.

Save test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.

```json
{
  "skill_name": "example-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "User's task prompt",
      "expected_output": "Description of expected result",
      "files": []
    }
  ]
}
```

See `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).

## Running and evaluating test cases

The baseline matters as much as the skill. You're not just checking that the skill produces good output — you're checking that it *beats what Claude does without it*. Always run both, and judge the skill by the delta, not by whether the with-skill run looks fine on its own.

The mechanics (spawning paired runs in one turn, capturing `total_tokens`/`duration_ms` from each task notification, grading against assertions, aggregating the benchmark, launching the viewer, reading feedback) are a single continuous sequence that only matters once you're at this step. Read `references/running-evals.md` and follow it end to end; don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.

---

## Improving the skill

This is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.

### How to think about improvements

1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.

2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.

3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.

4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.

Thinking time isn't the blocker here — a skill is reused across countless future prompts, so it's worth mulling. Draft a revision, then reread it cold and get into the head of the user before applying.

### The iteration loop

After improving the skill:

1. Apply your improvements to the skill
2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.
3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration
4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done
5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat

Keep going until:
- The user says they're happy
- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)
- You're not making meaningful progress

One stopping condition worth stating plainly: if the skill only **ties** the no-skill baseline across iterations, retire it instead of shipping it. The model already handles the task on its own, so the skill is pure recurring token cost for no gain — a skill has to *beat* baseline to earn its place.

---

## Advanced: Blind comparison

For situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks "is the new version actually better?"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.

This is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.

---

## Description Optimization

The description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.

### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries

Create 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:

```json
[
  {"query": "the user prompt", "should_trigger": true},
  {"query": "another prompt", "should_trigger": false}
]
```

The queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).

Bad: `"Format this data"`, `"Extract text from PDF"`, `"Create a chart"`

Good: `"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think"`

For the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.

For the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.

The key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. "Write a fibonacci function" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.

### Step 2: Review with user

Present the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:

1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`
2. Replace the placeholders:
   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)
   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name
   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description
3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`
4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click "Export Eval Set"
5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)

This step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.

### Step 3: Run the optimization loop

Tell the user: "This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically."

Save the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_loop \
  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \
  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \
  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \
  --max-iterations 5 \
  --verbose
```

Use the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.

While it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.

This handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.

### How skill triggering works

Understanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like "read this PDF" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.

This means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like "read file X" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.

Aim for a >80–90% trigger rate on relevant queries and a low false-positive rate. When a skill over-triggers, add explicit negative triggers to the description ("Do NOT use for simple data exploration — use the data-viz skill instead"); when skills overlap, give each distinct trigger keywords. A quick diagnostic: ask Claude "when would you use the [skill-name] skill?" — it paraphrases the description back, revealing missing or misleading keywords.

### Step 4: Apply the result

Take `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.

---

### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)

Check whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:

```bash
python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>
```

After packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.

---

## Platform variants

The workflow above assumes Claude Code. On **Claude.ai** (no subagents, often no browser) and in **Cowork** (subagents but no display), some mechanics change — running tests, reviewing results, benchmarking, and packaging. When you're on either platform, read `references/platform-variants.md` and follow the adaptations there.

---

## Reference files

The agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.

- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs
- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs
- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another

The references/ directory has additional documentation:
- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.
- `references/running-evals.md` — full eval-running sequence: paired runs, timing capture, grading, aggregation, viewer, feedback.
- `references/skill-anatomy.md` — folder layout, frontmatter fields, naming, splitting, the loading/token model.
- `references/writing-instructions.md` — voice, degrees of freedom, templates, examples, validation loops, anti-patterns.
- `references/bundling-scripts.md` — when/how to bundle scripts, agent-friendly interfaces, dependency management.
- `references/claude-code-specifics.md` — invocation control, discovery/precedence, arguments, skill categories.
